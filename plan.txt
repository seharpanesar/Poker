I want to come up with a poker simulation that runs a 6 player game of poker many times. I will not simulate
betting or gameplay. I will only distribute the cards and observe the outcomes.

With this simulation, I want to answer the following questions:
    - How often does a high card win? A pair? etc. Do for all types of hands, and create a graph.
    - If 1 player has a flush, how likely is it for another player to have a flush? How about with a full house?
    - What is the best hand to start with? Is it really AA? Do all pocketed hands have a decisive advantage over non pocketed hands?

            - runGame(deck): distribute 2 cards to each player. draw 5 cards for common pool,
              and call functions from util class to record outcome. return following items as tuple:
                - Winning hand (name of ranking and 5 cards)
                - All hands (name of ranking and 5 cards)

    - Util:

            - None

        - Functions:
            - getHandRanking(common pool, player hand)

        - Attributes:
            - None
        - Functions:
            - Run poker simulation x times (maybe 1000000 times) and record the data into dataframe. save dataframe as csv.
